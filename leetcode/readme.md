:dog: Hi, it's Steph. :dog:

This is a note to doc my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) solving methods and some data structure , algo scribbles. My main priority is to explain the solutions in a understandable way and doc multiple approach, and also figure things out to crack leetcode and coding interviews.  

Feel free to leave comments or suggestions on better solution, let's have fun :smile:
